Dark Web Price Index 2023 - Exclusive Research Menu Best VPN News Research Security Guides Experts About Search X Home Security Dark Web Price Index 2023 Dark Web Price Index 2023 By Miklos Zoltan . 23 April 2023 Founder - Privacy Affairs Shanika W. Fact-Checked this 15 Comments In 2022 and Q1 2023 dark web markets continued to bloom with a multitude of listings of various illegal goods and services. During the second half of 2022, law enforcement cracked down on a large number of darknet markets, temporarily disrupting the supply of such illicit goods. This, however, did little to deter cybercriminals. New websites and forums sprang up overnight. As in the previous 3 years, we conducted research into the supply and prices of various goods and services sold by cybercriminals on the dark web. This is what we found: Category Product Avg. dark web Price (USD) Credit Card Data Credit card details, account balance up to 5,000 $110 Card.com hacked account $75 Credit card details, account

Some of the biggest markets have disappeared within just a few weeks in the latter half of 2022. This, however, did little to reduce the supply of illicit goods and services on the dark web. New websites and forums were created nearly overnight and very quickly filled the gap left by the sites taken down by authorities. Sales volume: We have detected no long-term decrease in sales volume as a consequence of these law enforcement actions. New communities are quickly organized on new sites or forums. Data volume: During this reporting period we noted that sellers and buyers preferred to transact more bulk data rather than individual goods (such as ID cards, for example). This could indicate increase profitability of scams, frauds, and other shady activities. Prices: Most items and services we track for 3 years saw a significant decrease in pricing. This could mean that law enforcement action did little to reduce the supply of such goods as well as the fact that more people than ever fall victim to cybercriminals. Important Operations Changes As the Dark Web market evolves, its operators adopt strategies and priorities similar to those of traditional marketing and retail businesses. During the 2022-2023 reporting period, significant shifts in Dark Web operations were observed: No clear market leader: Unlike in 2020, 2021, and early 2022, in 2023 no market appears to dominate. In 2022 many previously prominent markets such as ToRReZ and the new AlphaBay were shut down. The gap of these larger sites was filled by several smaller sites, many of which usually disappear within just a few months. However, as explained, this did little to nothing in decreasing the supply of the illegally obtained goods and services sold. Dark web security ops: It appears that after the recent crackdown on the major darknet markets, cybercriminals adopted a new strategy of regularly launching new and smaller sites. Instead of focusing on operating bigger sites (that inevitably get seized by authorities), it seems that cybercriminals now periodically launch new and smaller sites that they then shut down after a few months. This allows them to better evade law enforcement action by attempting to wipe any evidence within just a few months and avoiding becoming big enough to raise too much attention. These new sites are then advertised on various cybercrime discussion forums and Telegram channels. Telegram instead of websites: Telegram has become a major channel for facilitating the sale of hacked personal data. Multiple channels with hundreds of thousands of users exist that facilitate the sale of such illegally obtained goods. 2023 Dark Web Product Price Index As with our previous reports, we gather data by scanning Dark Web marketplaces, forums, and websites. This information is then processed to generate an index of average prices for a broad range of specific products. Cloned Credit Cards and Cardholder Data In December 2022, an estimated 7.5 million credit cards were made available on the Dark Web. The average cost of credit card information varies from $10 (in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia) to $240 each (with a card balance). However, as demonstrated in the table below, there was a small general downward trend in the prices of these items. Product Avg. Price USD (2022) Avg. Price USD (2023) YoY Difference Israel hacked credit card details with CVV $25 $20 -$40 Credit card details, account balance up to 5,000 $120 $110 -$10 Credit card details, account balance up to 1,000 $80 $70 -$10 Cloned American Express with PIN $25 $20 -$10 Stolen online banking logins, minimum 2,000 on account $65 $60 -$5 Hacked (Global) credit card details with CVV $15 $10 -$5 Spain hacked credit card details with CVV $25 $20 -$5 Walmart account with credit card attached $10 $5 -$5 USA hacked credit card details with CVV $17 $15 -$2 Australia hacked credit card details w/ CVV $23 $23 $0 Cloned Mastercard with PIN $20 $20 $0 Cloned VISA with PIN $20 $20 $0 UK hacked credit card details with CVV $20 $20 $0 Stolen online banking logins, minimum 100 on account $35 $40 +$5 Canada hacked credit card details with CVV $10 $30 +$12 ING bank account logins (verified account) – $4,255 – Card.com hacked account – $75 – TDBank hacked account – $30 – United Arab Emirates credit card with CVV – $35 – Here is an example of a USA “Fullz” related posting with 15 confirmed sales: And here is an example of a credit card data related listing: Payment Processing Services Online payment methods such as mobile payments and payment processors are becoming more popular among retailers. Many people also prefer to buy goods and services online, which allows for more opportunities to steal people’s personal data and financial information. Despite a recent push for security awareness and forcing people to implement 2FA, a huge number of people still become victims of cybercriminals who manage to steal their online payment accounts. The most common type of account details for sale on the Dark Web are PayPal accounts. Because there are so many of them available, they are also very cheap to buy. (A more expensive option would be to get money transferred from a hacked account.) Current prices Product Avg. Price USD (2022) Avg.

This is likely due to the fact that cryptocurrency prices have been largely stagnating in H2 2022 and H1 2023, which resulted in less interest shown by the mainstream population. As a consequence of this, likely fewer crypto trading accounts and wallets were available for hackers to target. Prices are, however, expected to fall in case of a new cryptocurrency upturn, as this would lead to increased interest and hype from the general public. Prices of hacked cryptocurrency accounts still remain overall the highest among all hacked online accounts. This indicates that hacking such accounts still remains extremely profitable. Below you can find a screenshot of a hacked Coinbase account listing with confirmed sales: We have detected several new items listed on dark web sites that previously were not reported: New Cryptocurrency Accounts Avg.

The hacked accounts may belong to a country that has a larger selection of streaming sites than their own. This seems strange because people can use a VPN to bypass streaming site restrictions. For instance, a VPN can help you unblock Netflix. These are some examples of different types of hacked online accounts for sale: Forged Documents (Scans) A thriving category of illicit goods and services sold on dark web markets is that of scans of personal documents. Criminals can use this data to impersonate people on the internet and even open online accounts in their names. One could end up with their details being used to open accounts on various pornographic websites or cryptocurrency trading sites. Another popular category is that of ID and utility bill templates. Buyers can modify these items with any detail they desire. With some real information and some expertise, they can easily produce a collection of fake, authentic-looking documents. This is what we found: Product Avg. Price USD (2022) Avg.

The most in-demand currencies are euros, the British pound, and dollars from Canada, Australia, and the United States. Some of these bills have a guarantee that they can pass a UV pen test. Usually, these especially high-quality fake banknotes cost buyers around 30 percent of their face value. Document scans that include a selfie with the owner are another useful purchase. This is what an example of a passport template listing looks like: Forged Documents (Physical) Buyers can also get fake physical documents on the Dark Web. These are the most expensive items on the Dark Web markets by a long shot. Product Avg. Price USD (2022) Avg.

Most email dumps are compilations and collections of other email breaches, so the quality standards are usual—you get what you pay for. Email Database Dumps Avg.

Once installed, it grants hackers full access to the machine’s capabilities. This can result in hijacked computer resources through ransomware or stolen user information. Fake online casinos and social networks are common methods for distributing malware. To avoid infection, it’s best to avoid downloading anything from untrusted sources or websites.

This is achieved by overwhelming the targeted website’s server with thousands of connection requests, causing it to crash. While no information is stolen during a DDoS attack, it can be used for extortion or to conceal other hacking activities. The DDoS attacks listed below are characterized by their target, number of access requests, quality, speed, and duration. Note that the duration of a DDoS attack can vary from seconds to days and the results are often proportional to the price paid. Product Avg. Price USD (2022) Avg.

By following these suggestions, you can deter unwanted intruders from accessing your accounts at home or work. To minimize the risk of identity theft, consider implementing these strategies: Steer clear of public or insecure Wi-Fi When in a public place or any location where you doubt the network’s safety, employ a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt all communication. However, if a hacker gains access to the unsecured network you are on, they can easily view your account details and steal or modify your information. If you are interested in selecting a VPN, consult my guide about the best VPNs to the top options. While it may seem inconvenient, it is worth it. Adopt secure ATM habits Inspect ATMs for skimmers. Skimmers are devices attached to ATMs that resemble card readers, but they transmit your card data to a hacker instead of your bank. To check for ATM skimmers: Apply gentle pressure to the card slot’s sides. Look for any loose components, as skimmers are typically mounted delicately and will move when lightly pressed. Examine the edges for glue or tape. If you spot any adhesive material, avoid using the ATM and alert the bank. Abort the transaction if you struggle to insert your card into the ATM. Notify the bank about the issue. Look for counterfeit keypads. Fake keypads may be placed over real ones to record your PIN. They are often poorly mounted, so if the keypad appears to be off-center or wiggles slightly, stop using it and inform the bank. Safeguard your information ATMs are just one avenue through which sensitive account information can be exposed. Never disclose sensitive data over the phone. This applies even when the information is needed for critical procedures, such as registering for Social Security or obtaining a new driver’s license. If feasible, provide the information in person. Utilize anti-malware tools. Install anti-virus or other anti-malware software on your personal computer to scan for malware. Then, configure the update frequency to Automatic. Maintain Account and Password Cleanliness Every location where personal data is stored is a potential target for cybercriminals. Here are some methods to thwart unauthorized access to your data repositories. Refrain from using the same password across multiple accounts. This makes it simple for an attacker to breach your accounts. When a large list of account details is leaked on the dark web, your information can be cross-referenced with other services such as email or banking, so avoid using the same password for them. Terminate accounts that are no longer in use. Cybercriminals can exploit outdated information or use it in password resets or similar attacks. This is particularly dangerous if you reuse passwords for multiple accounts. Employ a password manager. Tools like LastPass or Keepass make it simple to generate robust passwords for all your accounts (with only a master password to remember). Many of these solutions are free. While these guidelines may appear complex and bothersome initially, they will become second nature once you become accustomed to them. This is when you will develop a crucial sense of cybersecurity both online and in everyday life. The Significance of This Data You may be questioning the relevance of these somewhat technical details. While dark web market data may not offer valuable insights to most individuals, the overall message is evident: Cybercriminals value your data, and stealing your identity or exploiting you is inexpensive. The abundance of purchasable data has led to a bulk sales mentality for dark web customers. Unfortunately, the increasing availability of personal information on the Dark Web results in lower costs—and consequently, a higher likelihood—that your accounts will be compromised. Therefore, the probability of being hacked is unpredictable but on the rise unless you take measures to protect yourself. By adopting a few straightforward rules and habits, you can make it more difficult for hackers to access your data and remove yourself from their line of sight. This not only helps protect your identity but also contributes to your overall cybersecurity in the digital age.
