This database contains many TB of data and information on billions of Chinese citizen,” the post said.“Databases contain information on 1 billion Chinese national residents and several billion case records, including: name, address, birthplace, national ID number, mobile number, all crime/case details.”The identity of the hacker is not clear. The Guardian was unable to verify the authenticity of the post, and several numbers in the sample database were no longer in use when contacted by the Guardian.Officials in China have yet to respond to the alleged data hack as of Monday.Yi Fu-Xian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he had downloaded the sample data available on the internet and found information related to his home county in Hunan province.“The data contained information about almost all the counties in China, and I have even discovered data related to a remote county in Tibet, where there are only a few thousand residents,” he said, adding that the demographic trend extracted from the data “is worse than the officials have reported”.‘Apocalypse mentality’, ‘revenge spending’ and an exodus in newly free Shanghai Read moreChina has in recent years seen a number of data leak incidents. In 2016, sensitive informationabout powerful Chinese individuals, including the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, was posted on Twitter.These incidents alarmed the Chinese authorities. Last year, China passed laws governing how personal information and data generated within its borders should be handled.Over the weekend, ChinaDan’s post has been widely discussed on China’s Weibo and WeChat social media platforms over the weekend, with many users worried it could be real.The hashtag “Shanghai data leak” was blocked on Weibo by Sunday afternoon, but there are still a few discussions on Chinese social media about this incident. Users expressed shock and dismay, with some saying they were now “transparent human beings”.Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, said in a post on Twitter it was “hard to parse truth from rumour mill”.If the material the hacker claimed to have came from the ministry of public security, it would be bad for “a number of reasons”, Schaefer said. “Most obviously it would be among biggest and worst breaches in history.”Zhao Changpeng, CEO of Binance, said on Monday the cryptocurrency exchange had stepped up user-verification processes after the exchange’s threat intelligence detected the sale of records belonging to one billion residents of an Asian country on the dark web.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTHe wrote on Twitter that a leak could have happened due to “a bug in an elastic search deployment by a (government) agency”, without saying if he was referring to the Shanghai police case.The claim of a hack comes as China has vowed to improve protection of online user data privacy, instructing its tech giants to ensure safer storage after public complaints about mismanagement and misuse.Explore more on these topicsHackingData and computer securityData protectionChinaAsia PacificPrivacynewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyKido nursery hackers threaten to publish more children’s profiles27 Sept 2025US nuclear weapons agency ‘among 400 organisations breached by Chinese hackers’23 Jul 2025How ‘native English’ Scattered Spider group linked to M&S attack operate1 May 2025‘Source of data’: are electric cars vulnerable to cyber spies and hackers? 29 Apr 2025Alder Hey children’s hospital explores ‘data breach’ after ransomware claims29 Nov 2024Chinese hackers collected audio from Trump campaign adviser’s calls – report27 Oct 2024Chinese believed to have targeted Trump’s and Vance’s phones in US telecommunications breach25 Oct 2024Russia’s FSB protected Evil Corp gang that carried out Nato cyber-attacks1 Oct 2024Justice department charges Iranian operatives in Trump campaign hack27 Sept 2024Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsContact usTip us offSecureDropPrivacy policyCookie policyTax strategyTerms & conditionsAll topicsAll writersNewslettersDigital newspaper archiveBlueskyFacebookInstagramLinkedInThreadsTikTokYouTubeAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsTipsAccessibility settingsWork for us Back to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
