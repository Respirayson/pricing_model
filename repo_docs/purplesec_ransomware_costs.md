Supply Chain Attack Statistics Not all attacks should be denoted as supply chain attacks, but due to their nature many of them are potential vectors for new supply chain attacks in the future. Organizations need to update their cybersecurity methodology with supply chain attacks in mind and to incorporate all their suppliers in their protection and security verification. Add this stat to the top (According to a recent survey, over 60% of security leaders) say they plan to deploy supply chain security measures in 2022. 78% reporting that their boards confer on this topic at least once every month.

Based on this data, the trend forecasts that 2021 may have 4 times more supply chain attacks than 2020. Suppliers’ assets targeted (second column [SA]), most attacks aimed to compromise: Code (66%), Data (20%), and Processes (12%). The compromised suppliers’ assets are used as an attack vector to compromise the customers. Those attacks are mostly done (third column [CT]): by Abusing the trust of the customer (62%) in the supplier, or by using Malware (62%) Considering that 83% of the suppliers are in the technology sector, the lack of knowledge on how attacks happened could either indicate a poor level of maturity when it comes to cyber defense in suppliers’ infrastructure or unwillingness to share the relevant information. In one study of 24 incidents, more than 50% of the supply chain attacks were attributed to well-known cyber crime groups including APT29, APT41, Thallium APT, UNC2546, Lazarus APT, TA413 and TA428. Social Engineering Statistics Social engineering is a type of cyber attack where threat actors attempt to retrieve sensitive information by manipulating people into providing sensitive data, account credentials, or granting access to networks or systems.Threat actors track our digital footprint to gather as much information as they can about an organization, its employees, and its vendors.

Cybersecurity Statistics By Solution Endpoint Detection And Response Statistics Endpoints are network-connected computing devices, capable of communicating with other points and devices across the network. Such devices come in many forms, from PCs, tablets, and mobile phones to smart vehicles and light bulbs. While these devices form endpoints on a network they are often the starting point of a cyber attack, which is why a focus on endpoint security is essential. This is especially relevant in a corporate environment, where sensitive business data is at stake.EDR has been adopted by more than a third of security teams as of 2020 (35%).The number of organizations using an EDR tool is expected to double (2x) over the next 5 years.Reducing incidents and breaches is the second leading factor for security spending.The percentage of organizations that will use Managed EDR services will grow to 25% by 2024.68% of organizations have experienced one or more endpoint attacks that successfully compromised data and/or their IT infrastructure.Gartner’s latest EDR Forecast predicts that global enterprises’ spending will reach $13.3 billion in 2021, growing tp $26.4 billion in 2025.82% of CISOs have reevaluated their security policies in response to the support needed for work-from-home (WFH) and virtual teams, endpoints often lack needed patches to stay secure or are overloaded with conflicting software agents.76% of IT security decision-makers say their enterprise EDR has increased in 2021.Global Market Outlook (2017-2026), sales of EDR solutions—both on-premises and cloud-based—are expected to reach $7.27 billion by 2026, with an annual growth rate of nearly 26%.39% of businesses reported cyber security breaches or attacks in the last 12 months.31% of businesses experience breaches or attacks at least once a week.1 in 5 of the businesses reporting cyber-attacks lost money, data, or other assets.70% of successful breaches begin on endpoint devices.44% of IT departments manage somewhere between 5,000 and 500,000 endpoints.68% of organizations suffered one or more endpoint attacks that successfully compromised their data and/or IT infrastructure.At least 87% of organizations permit employees to use personal mobile devices in the workplace. Thus, managing and securing mobile devices is one of the most vital EDR use cases for companies today.Additional research revealed that endpoints are among the most targeted, with 81% of companies reporting malware having infected their devices. AI Cybersecurity Statistics AI/ML—short for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing. The goal is to simulate natural intelligence to solve complex problems. The goal is to learn from data on certain tasks to maximize the performance of that task. AI is decision-making. ML allows systems to learn new things from data.61% of enterprises claim that they are unable to perform intrusion detection without using AI and ML.50% of organizations that deployed AI cybersecurity solutions used it to aim detection69% of organizations surveyed in a Capgemini study said AI security is urgent, and this number is likely to grow as more are hit by AI-driven attacks48% of the executives surveyed say they make extensive use of AI in cyber threat detection, 34% use it extensively for prediction, and 18% use it for a response.AI reduces the time taken to remediate a breach or implement patches in response to an attack by 12%.28% of respondents are using security products with AI embedded, with 30% using proprietary AI algorithms, and 42%, currently either use (or plan to use by next year).73% of respondents said they were testing use cases for AI for cyber security in some way.43% of executives see an increase in machine-speed attacks.Implementing machine learning into a company’s sales and marketing efforts shows a 47% increase.Recent machine learning statistics tell us that 80% of companies are planning to use A.I. at some point in the near futureMachine learning statistics show that this kind of technology increases business productivity by up to 54%.92% of top companies are currently investing in artificial intelligence.48% of businesses are using machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and natural language processing to effectively make use of large data sets.AI and machine learning reduce the effort required to detect and respond to cyber threats, making them cost-effective technologies.The average cost reduction is 12%, with some organizations lowering their costs by more than 15%.61% of organizations say they will not be able to identify critical threats without AI, while 69% believe AI will be necessary to respond to cyber attacks.Security automation and AI can save businesses more than 80% of the cost of manual security by reducing tech time and improving threat detection thanks to machine learning.51% of enterprises have plans to implement AI for automated processes.3 in 5 firms said AI improves the accuracy and efficiency of their analysts.Nearly 75% of executives said AI increases the accuracy of detecting a breach.AI reduces overall detection time, on average, by 12%.By 2025 over 50% of the revenue of the major consultancies will be derived from service delivery that leverages automation and AI instead of just human resources.3 out of 4 surveyed executives say that AI allows their organization to respond faster to breaches.69% of organizations think AI is necessary to respond to cyber attacks. SIEM Statistics A Security Information and Event Monitoring solution (SIEM) aggregates log and event data from an exponentially-growing number of data sources across the infrastructure (applications, network and endpoint security tools, cloud monitoring tools, identity providers, etc.).This data is then analyzed using predefined threat detection rules and queries to identify suspicious or unauthorized behavior. Costly to maintain: 75% of SIEM costs are operational after purchase.With a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5%, it’s anticipated to grow to $5.5 billion by 2025.Industry-wise, the retail and software industries combined make up 27% of the demand in the SIEM industry.Enterprise SIEMS are missing detections for 80% of all MITRE ATT&CK techniques.15% of SIEM rules are broken and will never fire due to common issues such as misconfigured data sources and missing fields.Only 25% of organizations that forward identity logs such as Active Directory and Okta to their SIEM, actually use them in their detection rules.On average, SIEMs only cover 20% of the 190+ adversary techniques described in MITRE ATT&CK v10.1.On average, SIEMs cover fewer than 5 of the top 14 techniques used by adversaries in the wild, based on 2021 threat intelligence data from Recorded Future, Red Canary, and Picus Security.On average, 75% of default out-of-the box (OOB) rules provided by SIEM vendors are disabled, due to the difficulty of adapting generic rules to each organization’s unique infrastructure, log sources, naming conventions, and more.The total cost of deploying a SIEM solution is:SIEM Software – $20,000 – $1 millionImplementation – $50,000Training – $0 – $10,000Resources – $74,000 – $500,000Hardware – $25,000 – $75,000Infrastructure – $10,00Among 300 IT and security leaders, the top outcomes respondents expect by switching to cloud-based SIEM include:40% —lower staffing costs.40% —lower operational expenses (OpEx).34% —lower capital expenses (CapEx).Cloud-based SIEM users spend, on average, $541,000 per year to support their solution, while on-premises companies are averaging $607,000.On-premises SIEM users are 11 percent more likely than cloud-based implementers to cite total cost of ownership as an existing challenge.Organizations are averaging 27 full-time employees to carry out SIEM-related infrastructure, maintenance, and training tasks.Among the cloud SIEM deployments, the majority (57%) made the migration in the past two years. It appears that a primary reason for this migration is cost.Despite 81% saying their security operations centers (SOCs) are adequately staffed, respondents admit their security personnel are spending far more time (60%) on routine IT operations tasks versus security-related functions (27%).If SIEM costs $1 million to purchase, operating expenses might easily reach $3–4 million annually. Virtual Private Network Statistics VPN stands for “Virtual Private Network” and describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data.A study found that 85% of free VPNs have permissions or functions that could compromise a user’s privacy, while 35% of VPNs expose a user’s traffic, and 18% contain potential malware or viruses.31% of internet users worldwide have used a VPN service.VPN usage increased by 27.1% in 2020 alone.88% of companies migrated employees to remote work in 2020, raising demand for VPNs.The top market for VPN usage in 2021 was Indonesia, with 44% of people using a VPN.By 2027, the VPN marketplace is projected to reach a value of $107.5 billion.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, VPN usage grew even more, and the market for VPNs is now expected to exceed $92 billion in 2027.49% of users choose VPNs for general security, whereas 31% of users connect to public WiFi through VPNs.A separate study of VPN apps with free plans available for Android devices found that 75% of the apps used third-party tracking, and more than 38% contained some type of malware.57% of mobile users used VPNs to access better TV, movies, and games, compared to 54 percent of PC or laptop users.VPN usage survey, nearly half of people that use VPNs did so for general security, while another (40%) did so for general privacy.Research has shown that VPNs increase data usage by anywhere between 4% and 20%, depending on which VPN protocol you’re using. Managed Detection & Response Statistics Managed Detection and Response (MDR) is a cybersecurity strategy focused on detecting cyber-attacks before they reach a critical stage. MDR relies on cloud computing, which provides important information about a threat and how it was detected. MDR takes this information and creates defensive measures to combat the attack.By 2025 50% of organizations will be using MDR services.94% of organizations are evaluating MDR services.79% of organizations are considering adopting MDR soon.68% of the MDR market is occupied by large businesses.By 2024 more than 90% of organizations looking to outsource security will focus on detection and response services.30% of organizations leveraging Open Systems MDR saw a reduction in overall risk.Organizations investing in MDR services saw a:50% reduction in the delta of Mean time to detect (MTTD) and Mean time to respond (MTTR).Up to 50% cost savings in Cyber security operations.60-75%+ attainment on first-to-know and first-to-report threats.
