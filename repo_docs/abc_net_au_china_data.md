(Reuters)abc.net.au/news/hacker-claims-to-have-stolen-1-billion-records-of-chinese-citize/101213964Link copiedShareShare articleA hacker claiming to have stolen personal data from a billion Chinese citizens is now selling the information online.Key points:Experts said the breach, if confirmed, would be one of the biggest in historyIt would also be a major violation of China's data protection lawsSome of the leaked data ranged from traffic accidents and petty theft to rape and domestic violenceA sample of 750,000 entries posted online by the hacker — using the handle "ChinaDan" — showed citizens' names, mobile phone numbers, national ID numbers, addresses, birthdays and police reports they had filed.AFP and cybersecurity experts have verified some of the citizen data in the sample as authentic, but the scope of the entire database is hard to determine.Advertised on a forum late last month but only picked up by cybersecurity experts this week, the 23-terabyte database — which the hacker claims contains the records of a billion Chinese citizens — is being sold for 10 bitcoin (more than $294,000)."It looks like it's from multiple sources. Some are facial recognition systems, others appear to be census data," said Robert Potter, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0.Loading Twitter content"There is no verification of the total number of records and I'm sceptical of the one billion citizens number," he added.Will China still use big data to track its citizens?China has used big data to trace and control the outbreak of COVID-19. Evidence suggests it will use those new capabilities to monitor citizens well into the future.China maintains an extensive nationwide surveillance infrastructure that siphons massive amounts of data from its citizens, ostensibly for security purposes.Growing public awareness of data privacy has led to stronger data protection laws targeting individuals and private firms in recent years, although there is little citizens can do to stop the state from collecting their data.Some of the leaked data appeared to be from express delivery user records, while other entries contained summaries of incidents reported to police in Shanghai over a span of more than a decade, with the most recent from 2019.The incident reports ranged from traffic accidents and petty theft to rape and domestic violence.'Heads will roll' At least four people out of over a dozen contacted by AFP confirmed their personal details, such as names and addresses, as listed in the database.Is Australia helping China track its citizens?China is monitoring millions of its residents through a high-tech surveillance web. Should Australia be helping Chinese tech giants develop surveillance technology?"So that's why so many people have been adding my WeChat over the past few days. Should I report this to the police?" said one woman surnamed Hao."I'm really confused about why my personal data has been leaked," said another woman surnamed Liu.In replies to the original post, users speculated that the data may have been hacked from an Alibaba Cloud server where it was apparently being stored by the Shanghai police.Mr Potter, the cybersecurity analyst, confirmed the files were hacked from Alibaba Cloud, which did not respond to an AFP request for comment.If confirmed, the breach would be one of the largest in history and a major violation of the recently approved Chinese data protection laws.Loading Twitter content"Heads will roll over this one," tweeted Kendra Schaefer, tech partner at research consultancy Trivium China.China's cybersecurity administration did not respond to a fax requesting comment.AFPPosted Wed 6 Jul 2022 at 6:25amWednesday 6 Jul 2022 at 6:25amWed 6 Jul 2022 at 6:25amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesGraphic footage shows Hamas executing people in the streets of GazaTopic:Unrest, Conflict and WarShould Donald Trump be thanked for Gaza ceasefire and hostage releases?EAnalysis by Eric TlozekNRL players face 10-year ban for joining rebel leaguesBREAKINGThe ocean's least natural predator has come for AustraliaTopic:OceansTerminally ill mum's life insurance cancelled after failure to declare UTITopic:CancerRelated storiesMore than 90,000 SA public servants had data stolen in payroll breach, Treasurer saysTopic:Cyber CrimeSpain's Prime Minister, Defence Minister targeted in mobile phone spyware attackTopic:Mobile PhonesWhen Russia invaded, one cybercrime group was quick to declare support.
